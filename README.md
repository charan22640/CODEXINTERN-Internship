## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas & Matplotlib
- **Folder:** `task 1 - exploratory-data-analysis-pandas-matplotlib/`
- **Description:**
  - Perform EDA on a sample dataset using Pandas and Matplotlib.
  - Generate visualizations: bar chart, scatter plot, and correlation heatmap.
- **How to Run:**
  1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  2. Run the analysis: `python eda_analysis.py`
  3. View generated plots in the same folder.

## Task 2: House Price Prediction with Linear Regression
- **Folder:** `task 2 - house-price-prediction-linear-regression/`
- **Description:**
  - Build a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features like rooms, size, year built, and location.
  - Includes preprocessing (one-hot encoding) and model evaluation (RMSE, RÂ²).
- **How to Run:**
  1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  2. Run the model: `python house_price_regression.py`
  3. View results and sample predictions in the terminal.

## Task 3: Matrix Operations Tool (NumPy)
- **Folder:** `task 3 - matrix-operations-tool-numpy/`
- **Description:**
  - Interactive command-line tool for matrix operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, and determinant calculation.
  - Built with NumPy for efficient computation.
- **How to Run:**
  1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  2. Run the tool: `python matrix_operations_tool.py`
  3. Follow the on-screen menu to input matrices and perform operations.
